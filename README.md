# Exploratory Analysis of Hazardous Chemicals in Cosmetics
This project presents an exploratory analysis of the Chemicals in Cosmetics dataset, compiled by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) under the California Safe Cosmetics Program (CSCP). The CSCP aims to provide the public with information about hazardous and potentially hazardous ingredients in cosmetic products sold in California, enhancing consumer awareness of product safety.
## Dataset Overview
The Chemicals in Cosmetics dataset includes information on 123 different chemicals across 114,381 observations. Each entry reports specific ingredients in cosmetic products flagged by the CDPH as hazardous or potentially hazardous.

The most commonly reported chemical is titanium dioxide (TiO₂), which appears in 93,479 products — making up 81.7% of the dataset's total observations.

## Key Focus: Titanium Dioxide
Titanium dioxide (TiO₂) is a widely used white pigment in cosmetics, primarily as an ingredient in sunscreens to protect skin from harmful UV radiation. However, its safety is debated due to concerns over nanoparticle exposure.

### Why Titanium Dioxide Matters
Inhalation Risks: TiO₂ nanoparticles have been classified as "possibly carcinogenic to humans" by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, and as an occupational carcinogen by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Studies indicate risks primarily through inhalation, as shown in animal studies.

Dermal and Oral Exposure: Although dermal penetration in humans is minimal, long-term effects and risks related to photo-oxidation products need further research. TiO₂ is also approved as a food additive (E171), but there is limited data on absorption and toxicity when ingested.

## Key Insights
1. Product Distribution by Chemical
The most commonly affected products include:

Eye makeup (eye colors, eyeshadows)
Nail products (lacquers, polishes)
Lipsticks

2. Brand Analysis
Among brands, Sephora, bareMinerals, and Revlon are the top three users of titanium dioxide. A breakdown of product types using this chemical includes:

* Sephora: 4.7% of titanium dioxide products are "Colorful Removable Eyeshadow Pans," followed by 2% as "Cream Lip Stains."
* bareMinerals: 24.4% of products are "Eyecolors," with 8.1% being "Ready Eyeshadows."
* Revlon: "Super Lustrous Cream Lipstick Restage" represents 5%, and "Blush Reno" makes up 3.7%.
* 
3. Temporal Analysis
The data includes reporting dates but not manufacturing or sale dates, so trends over time reflect report submissions rather than product release dates. Key findings include:

Peak Reporting Years: 2010 saw the highest number of titanium dioxide product reports, followed by 2019.
Low Reporting Year: 2012 had the fewest reports for products containing titanium dioxide.
Products with titanium dioxide have an average market duration of 2.4 years, with one year being the most common duration before discontinuation or report removal.
